I am deejay repeat & Dj'ing is a FULL time hobby now a days. 
I do this MORE for the FUN!!! Everything else will work itself out!
I began to Dj at 13 years old went from a bedroom dj to Club Dj in NYC during the late 80's early 90's.
Moved to Las Vegas in the early 90's & DJ'ed in a few clubs like the Metz, ICE, Club Rio before a family began.
I worked with a DJ for the 1st time at an event in 2018 & a spark was lit for music again. I missed the energy coming from the DJ booth after 25 or more years.
I have a dog as a pet, she is a English Bull Terrier named Lily.
Las Vegas is an awesome city BUT remember it's named Sin City for a reason.
LAs Vegas is known for it gambling, fun and non stop parties!
